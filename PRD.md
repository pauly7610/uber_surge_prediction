# Intelligent Surge Prediction System

## TL;DR

Uber will leverage AI-driven demand forecasting and proactive user notifications to reduce
reliance on surge pricing while optimizing supply and demand balance.

### Key Components:

- Prediction Engine – Uses ML models to forecast demand spikes 4-8 hours in advance
  based on historical trends, weather, local events, and real-time data.
- Smart User Notifications – Alerts riders in advance about potential surge pricing, allowing
  them to lock in rides at standard rates before demand spikes.
- Dynamic Pricing Incentives – Encourages ride bookings before peak periods through
  time-sensitive pricing offers.

This system aims to improve rider experience, reduce frustration with surge pricing, and
optimize fleet distribution for drivers.

## Implementation Note

This PRD represents the complete product vision. The current implementation is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that demonstrates the core user experience using mock data rather than actual ML models. This approach allows for rapid prototyping, user testing, and stakeholder feedback before investing in complex backend systems. See the README.md for details on the current implementation status.

## Problem Statement

Uber's current pricing model reacts to demand spikes by increasing fares dynamically. While
this balances supply and demand, it often results in rider frustration, lower trip completion
rates, and negative brand perception.

### Challenges today:

- Riders feel blindsided by surge pricing, especially during predictable peak times.
- Some users abandon trips or look for alternatives (public transit, competitors).
- Drivers may not be optimally distributed before peak periods, leading to inefficiencies.

### Key insight:

Much of Uber's demand surges are predictable (e.g., daily commute patterns, event crowds,
weather-driven spikes). Instead of reacting, we can predict and proactively influence
behavior.

## Goals

### Business Goals:

1. Increase completed rides by reducing trip abandonment due to unexpected surge
   pricing.
2. Optimize supply-demand balance by encouraging ride distribution before peak surges.
3. Improve brand perception by providing transparency and proactive planning tools.

### User Goals:

1. Riders avoid surge pricing by booking earlier or adjusting plans.
2. Drivers get distributed more effectively, leading to steady demand.
3. A more predictable and fair ride experience for all users.

### Non-Goals:

1. Eliminating surge pricing completely (it's still necessary in extreme demand situations).
2. Overloading users with excessive notifications.
3. Making manual intervention decisions—this should be fully AI-driven.

## User Stories

- As a frequent Uber rider, I want to be notified about potential surge pricing in advance so I
  can adjust my ride timing.
- As an event attendee, I want to secure a non-surge ride home before demand spikes.
- As a driver, I want demand forecasts so I can position myself in high-demand areas before
  a surge.

## Core Components & User Experience

### 1. Prediction Engine (Demand Forecasting System)

- Uses historical ride data, weather patterns, local event calendars, and social media
  signals to predict demand 4-8 hours in advance.
- Time-series ML models analyze:
  - Day of week, seasonality, and holidays
  - Real-time event data (concerts, sports games, conventions, etc.)
  - Trending signals from news and social media (major traffic incidents, flight
    delays, etc.)
- Predicts expected supply-demand imbalances to preemptively mitigate surges.

### 2. Smart User Notifications (Proactive Ride Alerts)

- Regular Riders:
  - Example: "Your usual Wednesday evening ride home looks like it'll be 2.1x surge
    around 6 PM. Book now for standard rates."
  - Users can pre-book their ride at current prices.
- Event Attendees:
  - Example: "Expecting high demand after the concert tonight at Madison Square
    Garden. Lock in your ride now."
  - Sent before the event ends, giving riders a chance to secure fares early.

#### Notification Strategy Matrix

Implementing tiered alerts per UX best practices:

| Alert Type          | Trigger Condition           | UI Treatment                        | Delivery Channel |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Pre-Surge Warning   | 4hr before predicted surge  | Expandable banner in app            | Push + SMS       |
| Price Lock Reminder | 1hr before offer expiration | Floating button with countdown      | In-app only      |
| Surge Activation    | Real-time demand spike      | Full-screen modal with alternatives | Push + vibration |

#### Notification Design Specifications

- Size: 320×120px
- Padding: 16px all
- Fill: #FFFFFF with 2px #E5E5E5 border
- Typography: Uber Move Text Regular 14pt

#### Notification Methods:

- Push notifications (Uber app)
- SMS alerts (for users who opted in)
- In-app ride booking reminders

### 3. Dynamic Pricing Incentives (Behavioral Nudges)

- Offers riders a guaranteed non-surge rate if they book within a time window before
  the predicted surge.
  - Example: "Book in the next hour for a guaranteed non-surge fare."
- Encourages smoother ride distribution, helping balance supply before the peak
  period.

### 4. Post-Booking Engagement Layer

#### Trip Confirmation Enhancements

- Surge Protection Summary
  - Section displaying locked price vs projected surge rate
  - Savings calculation ($12.50 saved vs 7 PM forecast)
- Driver Positioning Insights
  - "3 drivers being routed to your area" status
  - Animated illustration of vehicle movement

### 5. Driver Ecosystem Integration

#### Forecast-Aware Positioning

- Heatmap Overlays
  - Gradient layers showing predicted demand
  - 3-hour forecast intervals with opacity levels
- Positioning Incentives
  - "Earn +$12 by reaching downtown by 5:30 PM"
  - Uses existing driver app components with time badges

## Success Metrics

### Core Metrics

## Why This Matters

Surge pricing is one of the most complained-about aspects of Uber, yet it's necessary to
keep rides available during peak demand. Instead of waiting for riders to get frustrated, Uber
can predict surges in advance and proactively offer smarter alternatives.

### For riders, this means:

- Fewer surprises, more control over pricing
- Ability to plan rides ahead of time
- A more transparent and fairer Uber experience

### For drivers, this means:

- More stable demand without sudden surge drop-offs
- Better positioning before peak demand, maximizing earnings

### For Uber, this means:

- Higher completed rides = more revenue
- Better user sentiment around pricing transparency
- A smarter, data-driven approach to ride demand management

Instead of reacting to demand surges, Uber will now predict and help users intelligently.
